================== List | SETs | MAPs ===================

1. Write a program that reads a file and displays the words of that file as a list.

	First, display all words. !
	Then display them in reverse order. !
	Then display them with all plurals (ending with "s"). !
	Then display them with all plural words removed and the size of the updated list. 
	Also, remove all the duplicate/repeated words
